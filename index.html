    <h2>Dec 8, 2022</h2>
    <p>Today I set up git and github. We also started learning HTML by making 
      website. I really liked that in VSCode you can get an html boilerplate 
      set up by typing "!" in the first line. 
    </p>
    <p>Later I would like to try to figure out how to add this page to github
      by making a new repository. I learned how to do that from scratch earlier,
      but I do not know how to take a file that <em>already exists</em> and make
      it into a github repository.
    </p>
    <p>I was only able to add this to a git repository by creating a new repository
      and copying this file over to the new one. Still need to follow up on How
      to add an existing file into a repo.

      <li>How to make VSCode wrap at screen edge.</li>
      <li>Can I rename folders <strong>inside</strong> VSCode or do I have to
        do it in the terminal/window explorer?</li>
      <li>Inside the html, should I indent the paragraphs that go under a heading?
        It looks fine on the webpage, but is hard to read inside the html</li>
      <li>Is there a quick and free way to turn this into a website online? It
        would make it very helpful to be able to share with people without having
        to upload the file itself, for ex. in discord. Perhaps this is a good use
        for github.</li>
      <li>If every website needs to be named index.html how to I group webpages
        together? For ex. if I wanted this repo to have a new page for each month?</li>
    </ul>
