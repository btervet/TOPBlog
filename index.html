    <p>Today I set up git and github. We also started learning HTML by making 
      website. I really liked that in VSCode you can get an html boilerplate 
      set up by typing "!" in the first line. 
    </p>
    <p>Later I would like to try to figure out how to add this page to github
      by making a new repository. I learned how to do that from scratch earlier,
      but I do not know how to take a file that <em>already exists</em> and make
      it into a github repository.

    <p>Can I rename folders <strong>inside</strong> VSCode or do I have to
    do it in the terminal/window explorer?</p>
    <p>Inside the html, should I indent the paragraphs that go under a heading?
      It looks fine on the webpage, but is hard to read inside the html
    </p>
    <p>Is there a quick and free way to turn this into a website online? It
      would make it very helpful to be able to share with people without having
      to upload the file itself, for ex. in discord. Perhaps this is a good use
      for github.
